# IT2810 Website
This is our website for the second prosjekt in It2810.

## Build it on your local computer
To build this website on your local computer you need to first have installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then you can clone the repo and `cd` into it. From there you run the command ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` if you are using yarn. Then to run the website as a dev server you can run the command ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```. If you want to build the project instead you can run the command ```npm build``` or ```yarn build```. Which will build the project in the `/build` folder.
