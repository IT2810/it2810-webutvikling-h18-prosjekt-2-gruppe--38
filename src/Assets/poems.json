                "poem": "For a saving grace, we didn't see our dead,\nWho rarely bothered coming home to die\nBut simply stayed away out there\nIn the clean war, the war in the air.\n\nSeldom the ghosts come back bearing their tales\nOf hitting the earth, the incompressible sea,\nBut stayed up there in the relative wind,\nShades fading in the mind,\nWho had no graves but only epitaphs\nWhere never so many spoke for never so few:\nPer ardua, said the partisans of Mars,\nPer aspera, to the stars.\n\nThat was the good war, the war we won\nAs if there was no death, for goodness's sake.\nWith the help of the losers we left out there\nIn the air, in the empty air.",

Superstition saw\nSomething it had never seen before:\nBrown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,\nBeauty so sudden for that time of year.\n",
