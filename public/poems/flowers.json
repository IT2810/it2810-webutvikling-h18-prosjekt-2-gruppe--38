        "poem": "Boll-weevil's coming, and the winter's cold,\nMade cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,\nAnd cotton, scarce as any southern snow,\nWas vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,\nFailed in its function as the autumn rake;\nDrouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take\nAll water from the streams; dead birds were found\nIn wells a hundred feet below the ground--\nSuch was the season when the flower bloomed.\nOld folks were startled, and it soon assumed\nSignificance. Superstition saw\nSomething it had never seen before:\nBrown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,\nBeauty so sudden for that time of year.\n",
