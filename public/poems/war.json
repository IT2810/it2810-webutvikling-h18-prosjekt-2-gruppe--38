        "poem": "For a saving grace, we didn't see our dead,\nWho rarely bothered coming home to die\nBut simply stayed away out there\nIn the clean war, the war in the air.\n\nSeldom the ghosts come back bearing their tales\nOf hitting the earth, the incompressible sea,\nBut stayed up there in the relative wind,\nShades fading in the mind,\nWho had no graves but only epitaphs\nWhere never so many spoke for never so few:\nPer ardua, said the partisans of Mars,\nPer aspera, to the stars.\n\nThat was the good war, the war we won\nAs if there was no death, for goodness's sake.\nWith the help of the losers we left out there\nIn the air, in the empty air.",

        "poem": "It was wartime\nDaisies and Maisies in overalls\nWorked in factories\nSnapping gum in their teeth\nRation spunk\nTo keep them going\n\nThrough weekend tours\nAt the local USO\nOr late nights\nChecking hats\nFor the Willard rooftop garden\nIt was rough\n\nMaking ends meet\nWhile their men were at war\nIn radio worlds\nAnd newspaper print\nNights at home were spent reading\n\nLetters over and over\nLike prayers\nMouths shaped\nTo the words\nAnd Hershey bars\nMelted on radiators",

        "poem": "And when they bombed other peopleâ€™s houses, we\n\nprotested\nbut not enough, we opposed them but not\n\nenough. I was\nin my bed, around my bed America\n\nwas falling: invisible house by invisible house by invisible house.\n\nI took a chair outside and watched the sun.\n\nIn the sixth month\nof a disastrous reign in the house of money\n\nin the street of money in the city of money in the country of money,\nour great country of money, we (forgive us)\n\nlived happily during the war.",
